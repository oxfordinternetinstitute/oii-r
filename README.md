This repository holds the code for the ``oii`` R package used in the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) MSc Statistics Course. 

The package is most easily installed by opening R and executing the following command to install from CRAN:

```
install.packages("oii")
```

This package provides simple crosstab output with optional statistics (e.g., Goodman-Kruskal Gamma, Somers' d, and Kendall's tau-b) as well as two-way and one-way tables. The package is used within the statistics component of the Masters of Science (MSc) in Social Science of the Internet at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII), University of Oxford, but the functions should be useful for general data analysis and especially for analysis of categorical and ordinal data.

It is also possible to clone this repository and install the package in R using devtools. The commands to build the package are provided in build_publish.sh
